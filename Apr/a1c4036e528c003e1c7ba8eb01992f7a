L'Aquila, Italy - More than 800 aftershocks have rumbled through central Italy since Monday's devastating earthquake, including nine measuring between 4,0 and 5,0 on the Richter scale, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said Friday.
"This seismic phenomenon is giving us no respite, and it worries us," Berlusconi told reporters in L'Aquila, the Abruzzo capital at the centre of the disaster that claimed at least 289 lives.
Speaking after a mass funeral for 205 of the victims, Berlusconi updated the latest statistics on the disaster, as he has done on each of his daily visits to the scene since Monday.
"Nearly 40 000 people have been rescued (of whom) slightly more than 15&nbP;000 are staying in hotels and homes provided by individuals, and 24,138 people are in the tent camps," the prime minister said.
More than 12&nbP;000 personnel are involved in relief operations including 100 psychologists providing "moral support" and 200 technicians who are evaluating structural damage, he said. - AFPADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
