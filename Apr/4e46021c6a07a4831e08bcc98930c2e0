Jorhat, India - An Indian woman is hoping to enter the record books as the world's "hottest" woman after munching 51 fiery chillies in two minutes, organisers of the feat said Friday.
Anandita Dutta Tamuly, 26, chewed her way through the chillies before an audience late Thursday in India's northeast.
She consumed the chillies in the company of British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, who was producing a television show on food and anchoring the event in Jorhat, 300 kilometers (180 miles) east of Assam's main city of Guwahati.
"In two minutes, Anandita gobbled 51 red-hot chillies without batting an eyelid or shedding a tear, and also smeared seeds of 25 chillies into her eyes in one minute," Atul Lahkar, a chef who organised the show, told AFP.
The chillies are known locally as bhut jolokia and are a staple of local diet in Assam. They are recognised by Guinness World Records as the world's hottest chili pepper.
Guinness World Records had "asked us to provide them with a recording of the feat supervised by someone responsible. We asked Ramsay to be the adjudicator," said Diganta Saikia, another coordinator.
Tamuly said she became hooked on hot peppers when she was five-years-old.
"I had a sore tongue and my mother applied a chilli paste to cure the infection. After that I developed a penchant for chillies," Tamuly said. - AFPADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
