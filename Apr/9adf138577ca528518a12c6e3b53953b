London - A London bakery has started using the Internet messaging system Twitter to inform customers when the latest batches of bread hit the shelves.
Web-savvy regulars at the Albion bakery and cafe in east London no longer need to sniff the air to find out when the fresh batches are ready.
"The idea actually arose from quite a selfish desire - they just wanted a way to get the freshest baked stuff first," Albion manager David Dedrick told AFP.
The updates are sent using BakerTweet, a small, white bakery-proof wireless device that sends messages to subscribers on the Internet, such as "Lovely loaves just out of the oven. Hurry," or "Hot Cross Buns - fresh and hot like it's name... come and get them!"
Dedrick told AFP the system was working well and that freshly-baked goods had been selling out within minutes.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
"We're thinking of looking into other uses and extending the system to our restaurant and hotel rooms," he said.
The BakerTweet box was designed by the creative company Poke London, which is based across the road from the Albion. They intend to extend the service to other bakeries across the capital. - AFP
