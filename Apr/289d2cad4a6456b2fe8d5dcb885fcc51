Paris - Two large European telescopes designed to probe the formation of galaxies and the Big Bang believed to have created the universe will be launched on May 6, a spokesperson for France's National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) said on Wednesday.
The Herschel and Planck telescopes were to have been launched on April 16 in a dual operation by Ariane 5 rocket from the European Space Agency's base in Kourou, French Guiana.
The launch was postponed "to finalise the validation of the spacecraft operations procedures following recent software updates," the agency said on March 13. - AFP
